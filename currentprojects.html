	<h5>COOPERATIVES OR FARMER GROUPS ORGANISATION</h5>
<p>Cooperatives are generally regarded as an engine for poverty reduction and employment creation through collective self-help participatory involvement in some or all aspects of production, processing and marketing.  Whereas Cooperatives were largely founded on cash crop basis, established by government such as Cotton in the Teso region, the collapse of the cash crop meant the collapse of the cooperative
The current push for setting up cooperatives from bottom up, self-mobilized, is proving a challenge  and therefore the formation tends to remain as farmer groups to say the least. This would still suffice if to be deemed pre coop setting up, in preparation for establishing the cooperatives either by region or product.
Teso PEDO therefore in engaged in strategies and processes of these formation or indeed appraising those already formed, to ensure they will transit to cooperatives, but firstly be functional and effective Joint Production Groups (JPGs.)
With Local government needing support of implementing extension service delivery for production and productivity, Teso PEDO identifies the key aspects of supervision and capacity building and has therefore embarked on establishing a layer to this formation by instituting a District Manager DM, to liaise with the district local government supervised by our central office. The DM in turn supervises appointed sub county coordinators SCC, who work with the farmer groups, JPGs and liaise with the key mobilization unit of government, the 3 and sub county chiefs.
Because of this work, Households are forming into JPGs and therefore can be aggregated for Production, Markets, Learning, or accessing Productions support services such as Finance inclusion as well as Essential life welfare services.
All members are encouraged to be part of the farmer group.</p> 

<h5>CASHEW VALUE CHAIN DEVELOPMENT.</h5>

<h6>WHY CASHEW</h6>
<p>The question of global warming and the climate change effects on Agriculture, food security, natural survival, and health is no longer a debate but a reality that must be addressed with no further delay. 2019 has seen unprecedented temperature levels, extended periods of intense heat and resulting devastation on water stocks and vegetation, and now as I write the real threat of famine in most already vulnerable regions.
Teso and neighbouring regions, the zoned as a cattle corridor, that depend on pasture and water for entire life and wellbeing, have seen the worst of the effects. Teso possibly has suffered from deforestation as communities have continued cutting trees for survival and not with any replanting program.</p>

<p>The program to plant trees is therefore as urgent as can be. Whereas there are choices of trees to plant, with an element of income prospect years down the line, and indeed there has been a push of fruit trees besides pine and uculptures, Cashew is therefore being fronted as a national directive for very strong reasons below among many:
Ideal perennial crop for the semi-arid and resilient to harsh weather conditions.
High global market value for its products and has very strong market segments that will guarantee sustainable incomes and therefore better livelihoods
Easy agronomy compared to the traditional crops, and can still leave land available for other crops.
Viable employment along the value chain as there will be vibrant economic activities supported by commercial viability of the industry
High Incomes will also stimulate other economic and social development activities in particular funding and enabling the services of Essential Life needs such as Health Education Housing, Water and Sanitation etc
The planting of Cashew has therefore been endorsed on the following three forefronts AND Teso PEDO is leading on the efforts:
As a national priority crop and to be supported by the relevant government ministries as per the Presidents directive of Dec 2017.
The communities through the Ateker clan movement in quest for sustainable incomes as well as restoring forest to mitigate Climate challenges
Cashew nut is easily the current most demanded and high value nut in the market and production is not anywhere near enough, even for the foreseeable future.
Teso PEDO is particularly fronting the following project activities supporting households and farmers:
Sensitising on varieties of planting materials and guiding on procurement and distribution with other agencies.
Producing planting material , Potting and Grafting
Supporting in farm planning  planting
Strengthening formation of farmer groups and leading on the formation of the industry cooperative.
Teso PEDO is pledging to support the creation of 100,000 millionaires in the Teso region fronted by Cashew value chain economic strategy by simply planting at least 100 trees per member.</p>
	





<h5>FREE RANGE CHICKEN INITIATIVE	</h5>
<p>The People and Economy of Teso region including external markets are familiar with Free range Chicken and its value as domestic food security and nutrition with an element of cash income due to its high liquidity
The two aspects of our work on this value chain is to transit it to a full commercial value offering including being an enabler for subsequent investment plans.
We are establishing vaccination and treatment of chicken, being vulnerability to diseases that always undermines and dwindles stock. We are also committing to training the household members on other crucial aspects of supplemented feeding, drinking and housing of Chicken, the latter exposes stocks to pests
Our ambition iis to have more than 60% of households each have at least 20 Chicken being reared, that would aggregate to 10 million of chicken, with vibrant formal commercial economy .
Our efforts also include strategies such as hatching eggs for the households and availing chicks, breed selection and strengthening other market segments such as eggs.</p>
